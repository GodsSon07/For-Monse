          <p>They say beauty isn't just about what the eye can see, but instead its the very essence of ones being. Beauty is WHO you are not just what you are. You are drop dead gorgeous, from your head to your toes, you radiate this very essence everywhere you go. Elegant, resilient, graceful, smart, stylish, exquisite...Monse you embody these traits with ease. Lighting up every room you  enter, like a bundle of sun, with a smile that can light up the night, and your eyes tend to give a little twinkle, like the stars in the sky. Across the world, there isn't a woman who can compete with your shadow, you have more beauty in your pinky toe than any woman I've come in contact with. 
            <br>
          That being said....the TRUE treasure of who you are comes from the unseen. For example, your selfless heart, your loving and caring nature, or your loyalty. A blind man could see you, plain as day, from a distance, as if you were standing right in front of him. Your beauty is unmeasurable, you're the type of woman who can walk into a room and demand attention without even saying a word. Monserrat Rivera you are truly a blessing to this earth, a treasure more precious than gold, rubies, diamonds, or any other worldy treasure, and this world wouldn't be the same without you.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align:center;">Memories</h1>

            <p>It’s crazy thinking back to the first time I met you, those Amazon days. At first contact we hardly spoke two words to each other besides "Hi how are you?". After that I would see you in passing throughout the warehouse. You always seemed to catch my attention.  Then the day came when we actually spoke. I remember we were upstairs, there was no work for us to do so the bosses just had us doing miscellaneous things. It was the end of June, 2019. I introduced myself and you told me your name was “Monserrat”. We got to talking and you had me ENTHRALLED, hanging on your every word, following you throughout the warehouse as we talked about how you nannied, how you loved to play soccer, and that one time you got out of a ticket with preds tickets. When we parted ways that day I knew you were special, I just didn’t know how special you were going to be to me. 
            <br>
            <hr>
            After that day we spent almost every work day eating lunch together, I remember the first time we ever ate together was in ‘Selina’ ( that silver Hyundai you drove sometimes.). I looked forward to everyday because I got to see you, eat lunch with you, and spend time with you. The first time we ever hung out outside of work, was at that steakhouse in Smyrna. You introduced me to their carrot cake. It was so good! We used to go after work sometimes to go get ice cream at menchies.  (You introduced me to that place as well). The night I knew you were going to be important to me was the day we went to go eat at Carrabba's, side note you could NOT park that day lol. You were so beautiful though, your hair was curled and you wore that light Jean jacket with flowers on it. You had gotten a gift for my friend Ami’s baby shower. We also went to hang out with some of my friends at a bar in cool springs. What made that night special for me was the gift you got me. The journal and the book of scriptures. I had never had a journal before and you thoughtfully wrote little encouraging notes and scriptures in it to brighten my day. (I still use that journal, and reading your words still brings me joy. ) I knew then you’d be IMPORTANT to me. We made other great memories as well, like the Chattanooga trip when we visited the aquarium( I saved my ticket from that day, I still have it). Or the time we went for margaritas in smyrna, the resturant closed but we just sat in my car for hours and just talked. My last night in Nashville was also very memorable for me, because of you. We went to Bar Louie in the gulch. That was the first time I got to hug you, it was bittersweet because it was a hug goodbye but still....I cherish those memories.

            Then  I ended up moving. That was a very hard decision for me. I was't expecting to meet you Monse and I was concerned that moving would separate us, and cause our connection to grow distant, but in some ways I felt closer to you because of it. Moving made me realize some of the most important things in my life. It forced me to get closer to Jesus Christ, because he was all I had. It mended family bonds that had grown distant, it also made me realize just how important you are to me Monserrat. We would talk on the phone sometimes for hours. I used to look forward to the weekends because that meant I got to catch up with you. To this day my favorite memory of us is when you called me and we were on the phone for two hours and we were just listening to music while you cleaned your house. It's such a simple memory, but it sent sparks through my spirit. There was a time when it was like we were in this dance , and I didn't want that dance to end. I had never experienced a connection like that with anyone, I knew then you were going to be not just IMPORTANT, but VERY special to me as well.

            Then we went through storms because I was immature in spirit, I didn’t know how to love correctly , I was impatient, I was selfish, I was insensitive to you, I wasn't a good friend, I didn't put you first, and I tried to take things into my own hands, instead of allowing things to just be. I dropped the ball. I was focused on “getting you” because I didn’t want to lose you, instead of focusing on the source of all things, and letting HIM work,  because only in and through Christ will I ever be able to BECOME and STAY the man that you deserve, and not fumble the blessing that you are, because you deserve the best of everything. I acted irrationally and I acted stupid. I’m truly sorry for my actions. I messed everything up. It sucked how things ended between us. I'm not going to lie, it was very painful, it felt like my heart was split in two. I felt stupid, and at first I was angry, it really sucked thinking about you dating someone else, but I could only be angry with myself. This outcome was the cause of MY actions and MY stupidity. You're a Queen, and a Queen has many options, you also deserve to live the life YOU want without it being dictated by anyone BUT God. All I can do is pray I get the opportunity to connect with you again. You're someone who only comes around once in a lifetime. I'm sorry if I ever took talking to you for granted. 
            <br>
            <hr>
             Today is your birthday. I know we're not talking but I miss you. You're so beautiful. I miss our connection, it was one I truly cherished. I miss your voice, I miss seeing your name pop up on my phone. I miss laughing with you, I miss hearing your thoughts. I miss our conversations. Youre in my thoughts and prayers daily Monse. I love you. I truly do. You're my best friend and I wouldn't be on the tradjectory I am in life right now if I never got to meet you. You pointed me to my strength, at a time when I felt my strongest but was actually at my weakest. I wouldn't have known TRUE love if it wasn't for you. You pointed me to Jesus Christ. Thats why you mean the world to me, that's why youre so special to me, that's why I treasure you so much. You're irreplaceable.

             I know IF our paths cross and we ever speak again we will both be different people, I know God has had his hand in our lives and I think thats what will make our connection so beautiful, because only through Christ will our connection rekindle and flourish, and resting on that fact is beautiful within itself. I pray on that...God's timing is perfect. On my end, things may change, seasons may change between us, time passes, feelings may be scorched and burned, but at the root of everything I will always love you. That will never change. I pray for your happiness and your peace of mind. I pray for your protection, for you and your family.

             Well, I hope youre enjoying your day, and I hope that you're doing okay. I miss you so much, I think about you daily, I miss our connection. I really want the opportunity to dance with you again Monse.
             May God Bless you, may peace be with you. Cheers.
